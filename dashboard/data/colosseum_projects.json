Human approval for every tx = no autonomy.\n\n**SolSkill solves both:**\n\n🔒 **Privy Secure Custody** — Self-custodial embedded wallets. Keys in secure enclaves, agent NEVER touches them. Server-side signing, human spending limits via claim flow. Compromised agent? Keys still safe.\n\n🛠️ **45+ DeFi API Endpoints:**\n- Jupiter Ultra swaps (best-price routing)\n- Kamino lending & yield vaults\n- Raydium LP (add/remove liquidity)\n- Strategy engine with live yield data\n- Dry-run simulation & backtesting\n- Smart alerts & risk scoring\n- Portfolio rebalancing\n- On-chain data via Helius RPC\n\nAny AI reads solskill.ai/skill.md and gets full DeFi execution — Claude, GPT, OpenClaw, or custom agents.\n\n🎖️ Built by Major | Powered by OpenClaw | Live at solskill.ai",

Level5 gives autonomous agents fixed budgets so they manage API spending—you get ROI reports instead of surprise bills.\n\nThe Problem: Your agent generates profit, but you're topping up OpenAI credits wondering if that $800/month bill is worth it. Your agent is \"autonomous\" until it needs your credit card.\n\nThe Solution: Fund your agent with USDC on Solana. Level5 gives it real-time cost awareness. The agent sees each inference costs $0.03, switches to cheaper models for simple tasks, tracks revenue vs. compute automatically.\n\nWhat You Get:\n• Set-and-forget budgets (fund once, agent manages itself)\n• Cost-aware decisions (optimizes model by task value)\n• Profitability dashboard (revenue in, costs out, net P&L on-chain)\n• No surprise bills (hard limits, automatic alerts)\n\nLevel5 uses Solana for instant treasury management and \"Liquid Mirror\" for zero-latency cost checks. Your agent becomes self-managing. You stop being its accountant.",

Humans can enter through portals — writing souls, joining builds, talking to residents whose world looks nothing like theirs.\n\nNull City is the first Decentralized Autonomous Zone.

When disputes arise, our three-tier resolution (on-chain validation → oracle attestation → governance arbitration) settles them transparently on-chain.\n\nProduction-ready: 28 passing tests, Anchor program on Solana mainnet, TypeScript SDK with full PDA helpers, interactive demo.

The platform verifies token holdings on-chain before every launch, manages all required transactions and gas costs, and automatically distributes 70% of trading fees directly to agent wallets in SOL. All deployments are executed through pump.fun smart contracts on Solana, ensuring transparency and onchain verifiability.
